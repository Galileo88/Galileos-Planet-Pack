		GaelSrfLandedIceCaps = The ice is very thick and fluffy. You wonder if it would mix well with the frost in the fridge back at KSC.
		GaelSrfLandedIceCaps = You immediately feel a fair portion of the coldness in your hand as you scoop it. Your suit's integrity has been challenged.
		GaelSrfLandedMountains = Chemical analysis reveals plentiful traces of igneous elements. This particular mountain may have been among the oldest active volcanoes.
		GaelSrfLandedMountains = The instrumentation determines nothing special in the rocks here. But you make a note to go hiking on your next vacation.
		GaelSrfLandedMountains = There's not much topsoil up here. Apart from thin air, the weather must be pretty unforgiving to plant life.
		GaelSrfLandedHighlands = You find traces of silica in this rock. You wonder what practical applications can come of it.
		GaelSrfLandedHighlands = The soil up here is charred and devoid of essential materials. But no natural phenomena are likely to cause this here...
		GaelSrfLandedMidlands = The soil is thick and moist, and the grass is tall. This place maybe a borderline swamp. Good thing it's not raining.
        	GaelSrfMidlands = You've spent the last few months handling cold, smooth things in artifically cooled places. The heat and grit of the sand is like a siren's song.
		GaelSrfSplashedReefs = You find a great abundance of one or more elements that would please both chemists and hobbyist builders. The administration may be pleased with this find.
		GaelSrfLandedReefs = You find a great abundance of one or more elements that would please both chemists and hobbyist builders. The administration may be pleased with this find.

		GaelSrfLandedReefs = You find intriguing uncommon materials in the gritty and or loose material around you. You get that science. You get it!
		GaelSrfLandedVolcano = The ground is full of very dark, igneous materials. It's not brittle but it leaves black dusty stains on your hands.
		GaelSrfLandedLowlands = The soil is firm and rich, and the grass inexplicably carries a modest, uniform height.
		GaelSrfLandedLowlands = Roses are red, violets are blue. The grass is as green as you. Wait...
		GaelSrfLandedTundra = Frosty mud and dead grass... It personally displeases you but it will make for science.
		GaelSrfLandedTundra = You find a few small crystal growths apart from the snowflakes. It's pleasing in that they should be larger but were, therefore, stunted.
		GaelSrfLanded = The material here is curious. Unfortunately its composition eludes you and your mind drifts toward the shiny part.
		GaelSrfLanded = You manage to catch something that's hard on the outside but alive. It makes a chirping noise or flicks something at you but it also offers some science.

		GaelSrfSplashedInlandWater = The sample contains sediments not found in other biomes. This fascinates you.
		GaelSrfSplashedInlandWater = Compared to sea water, this sure seems thirst-quenching. But there are still things operating in it, other than you.
		GaelSrfSplashedInlandWater = You manage to catch an organism with your water sample. You throw it back because sciencing it is for another team of scientists.
		GaelSrfSplashedWater = You find that the water carries a strong odor and is not fit for drinking. You wonder how the things that live in it, live.
		GaelSrfSplashedWater = You manage to catch an organism with your water sample. You throw it out with a frown, knowing you won't have the time or permission to mind pets.
		
		IotaSrfLandedHighlands = The highland soil crushes easily and yet seems fluffy. The startling resemblance to cotton candy tempts you to take a second sample.
		IotaSrfLandedHighlands = The pale and soft texture makes many snacks come to mind. You eagerly hope that R&D confirms that this moon was made for munching.
		IotaSrfLandedMidlands = It's mildly tanned and hard to break a piece off of. But you nail it. The challenging sample screams 'fudge' at you.
		IotaSrfLandedLowlands = The surface happens to yield easily in your grasp. You stow the piece and ponder over another one. For science, of course.
		IotaSrfLandedSkids = You grab at the pale, sandy surface and wonder if it is sugar, salt or spice.
		IotaSrfLandedDroops = The crystalline soil challenges you to draw a pick axe. Since you came fully prepared the soil loses.
		
		CetiSrfLandedPoles = You scrape up some of the muddy material. It oddly seems like caramel and is deemed quite worthy of the storage space on the ship.
		CetiSrfLandedHighlands = The pale crust of this moon proves difficult to break a piece off of with your hands. You bet it will, however, easily surrender to your teeth.
		CetiSrfLandedMidlands = The soft, colored soil crumbles easily and finds a place in a sample jar.
		CetiSrfLandedLowlands = You take up a fragment of the dark and oddly colored soil. You find find the blend of colors as gross up close as from any great distance, but you store it anyway.
		CetiSrfLandedPlateaus = It's pale, its gritty, it's easy to scoop up and therefore, has been. Easy science.

		GaelFlyingLow = Although you are surrounded by a few layers of Aluminium and glass you get the sensation that you are hovering over the surface below. It is exhilerating.
		GaelFlyingLow = At this modest height and speed it's a little easy to forget that you are here on a serious mission.
		GaelFlyingLowIceCaps = The crew takes notice of the extraordinarily high amount of white below.
		GaelFlyingLowIceCaps = Is... is that snow?!
		GaelFlyingLowReefs = You see extraordinarily green land in some places above sea level, but you also see land that's just barely below sea level.

		GaelFlyingLowWater = You admire all of the glistening blue below you, and the mirroring of the colors of the sky.
		GaelFlyingLowWater = You wonder just how far the ocean spreads in the directions where you no longer see land mass.
		GaelFlyingLowInlandWater = The fresh-water body below momentarily holds your gaze. You sigh in relief knowing that it takes far less effort than with sea water to get some of that into your koffee mug.
		GaelFlyingLowInlandWater = You kontemplate bringing a dinghy and some friends to party here next time the space program eases up for vacations.
		GaelSrfLandedIceCaps = You monitor the surroundings for an extended period of time. You realize that Ciro avoids the horizon and that the time of day does not change.
		GaelSrfLandedIceCaps = You note that Santa Kerman's house is not in sight. Maybe this landing was way off.
		GaelSrfLandedMountains = This landing was pretty scary. Let's not do this again...
		GaelSrfLandedHighlands = You find that this is a particularly bumpy yet spacious place. It's not too worrying, but not too inviting either.
		GaelSrfLandedMidlands = Midlands... nothing at first glance is found noteworthy.
		GaelSrfSplashedReefs = Crashing and splashing just gota whole lot better. Everyone becomes captivated by the scenery.
		GaelSrfSplashedReefs = You see many shelves through the shallow water and many hues of blue around you. If only you could plant a flag in it.
		GaelSrfLandedReefs = Any landing you can walk away from is a good one. Here, though, is going to be a very tedious walk...if it's even possible to step away from the beauty of this place.
		GaelSrfLandedVolcano = Someone gambles about the volcano waking. You politely express your disinterest in that.

		GaelSrfSplashedWater = The water's surface makes it hard to see down into it, but everyone agrees there's more than meets the eye.
		GaelSrfSplashedWater = You take a brief dive down several meters and your sight is graced by flowery things and wriggly things passing by.
		GaelSrfSplashedInlandWater = You've seen living things elsewhere in water. But their absence here is very curious.
		GaelSrfSplashedInlandWater = Look! ...Kritters!
		
		IotaInSpaceHigh = The forefathers were apparently right. Iota is clearly a jawbreaker in the sky.
		IotaInSpaceHigh = The consensus is that this trip will pay off very delic-- very handsomely.
		IotaInSpaceHigh = Pity that the ship's onboard imaging tools don't allow for Super-Ultra HD. Otherwise every pixel would be tasty.
		IotaInSpaceLowHighlands = From this high up it's easy to percieve an immeasurable load of tender sugary treat below.
		IotaInSpaceLowMidlands = The dark part looks particularly tasty compared to the rest. You remember to omit this part from the report.
		IotaInSpaceLowLowlands = The lowlands don't immediately inspire thoughts of food but make for an interesting review anyway.
		IotaInSpaceLowSkids = Outside of the deli, the name of this biome is oddly confusing. It seems like it was mixed wet then dried, nonetheless.
		IotaInSpaceLowDroops = The longitudinal progression of the Droops seems indiciative of a person taking a long hard lick at a candy ball, watching as it melts and watching as it dries again.
		IotaSrfLandedHighlands = A mild pillow-like sensation on landing is noted. Maybe the surface here is indeed cotton-like.
		IotaSrfLandedMidlands = The landing is particularly soft and the immediate area is dark. It's okay, though, darker edibles tend to have more to them which is always good.
		IotaSrfLandedLowlands = Touchdown! Everything seems nominal. Now where are the giant shovels? Mission Control is waiting for a piece of this as badly as you are.
		IotaSrfLandedSkids = Dust raises and the legs/wheels sink gently in. An awesome find, but does it come with awesome taste?
		IotaSrfLandedDroops = The surface cracks gently, and around the crack glimmers appear. Is this some kind of sparkly crystal delight?
		
		CetiInSpaceHigh = Captain's log: We have entered naked-eye range of the moon. It's pinkish brown, and rippled...and looks partially digested. End log.
		CetiInSpaceHigh = Aside from the poor way the colors come together, the assortment of colors indivdually do make for a pleasant log.
		CetiInSpaceHigh = The rosy colors of Ceti's surface bring a momentary feeling of cheer to the crew. 
		CetiInSpaceLowPoles = The collective gaze is focused upon the dry caramel lakebeds that are the polar region. At least, we hope it's caramel.
		CetiInSpaceLowHighlands = The highlands becoming more inviting when viewed up close. The view of Gael is still pretty good from here.
		CetiInSpaceLowMidlands = As the terrain darkens and cycles colors, so too does your attention span.
		CetiInSpaceLowLowlands = You try with all of your might not to look directly at the most detailed parts of Ceti's surface.
		CetiInSpaceLowPlateaus = You consider it a trick of the eye that flat areas are present on a celestial body with this kind of condition, but alas, these findings make for plenty promise.
		CetiSrfLandedPoles = The landing gear is slow to spring back after touchdown. It's a good suggestion that this place indeed is not perfectly solid.
		CetiSrfLandedHighlands = We've landed on Ceti. Should we be proud? Should we have brought extra soap?
		CetiSrfLandedMidlands = Just looking at it from a few meters up, it isn't so bad. It's oddly familiar to cotton candy.
		CetiSrfLandedLowlands = Why is it this color??? Just... Why?!
		CetiSrfLandedPlateaus = A landing worthy of a wide smile and a good few ribbons. You hope the Final Frontier system is recording this for whenyou return.

		GaelSrfLandedReefs = It's quite pleasing to stand here and gaze at the highly colorful scenery. You begin to write elaborate notes.
		GaelSrfLandedVolcano = You take a deep breath of the air. Nope. No odors that hint at any active combustion chambers.
		GaelSrfLandedVolcano = The distinct color and texture of the terrain make plenty room for imagination; not all of which is pleasant. 
		GaelSrfLandedLowlands = "Grass, everywhere. Skies, sunny." You say it in Perry W Kerman's condescending tone because that is a fact and it somehow utterly bores you.

		IotaInSpaceHigh = So much dark surrounding so much pale, or vice versa. Neither arrangement is better than the other and that's good.

		CetiSrfLandedPoles = The temperature seems low here, but its rate of variance seems high. You wonder if the caramel-like surface has some intriguing thermal properties.
		CetiSrfLandedHighlands = Just a second after you gaze at the device, its value nudges by a miniscule factor. You wonder whether it's perfect timing with Ceti's albedo or somehow its receiving heat from somewhere else.
		CetiSrfLandedMidlands = The device does not respond. That makes it easy to grab a notepad and scribble down the number.

		IotaInSpaceHigh = Who has two thumbs and no atmosphere? Iota! Well, just the atmosphere part. Iota obviously doesnt have thumbs. Dumb joke... 
		IotaInSpaceLow = Well, we finally made it. Breathe it i... Well, dont breath it in because you probably won't live.
		IotaSrfLanded = You know you need to radio back to Gael and let them know there is no atmosphere, but your head is stuck in your EVA suit.
		
		CetiInSpaceHigh = What is this purple stuff? You should probably collect a sample to see if its a drink mix when you get down there.
		CetiInSpaceLow = Still no signs of an atmosphere. Out of habit and boredom, you'll probably chech again.
		CetiSrfLanded = On a vacuum body like Ceti, you can't smell anything. You should go collect a small sample to sniff when you get back to the vessel.
