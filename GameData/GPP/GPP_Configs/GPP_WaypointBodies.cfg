// This file contains a mapping of all stock celestial bodies to icons.
// To add mappings (ie. for custom planets), create your own CFG file following

// Note that the configuration only specifies a directory to be searched.  The
// mapping matches the celestial body name to the file names of the images
// within the specified directories.
