		//GPP/GPP_Configs/GPP_Kerbalism.cfg
			#LOC_GPP_KerbalismGeiger_CiroSrfLanded = 嗯……不！			
			#LOC_GPP_KerbalismGeiger_CiroFlyingLow = 海妖之子哇！						
			#LOC_GPP_KerbalismGeiger_CiroFlyingHigh = 现在，你真的没办法区分这倒是是电离层的作用还是纯粹的热感应。
			#LOC_GPP_KerbalismGeiger_CiroInSpaceLow = 如果你还活着并能够阅读这条信息，那你肯定在和阳光发生反应了。									#LOC_GPP_KerbalismGeiger_CiroInSpaceHigh = 阳光不受任何行星的阻碍，肆意地烧灼着。
			#LOC_GPP_KerbalismGeiger_IcarusSrfLanded = 虽然盖格计数器试图冷静下载，不显示任何读数，但它仍被炙烤着，就像周围的一切。
			#LOC_GPP_KerbalismGeiger_IcarusInSpaceLow = 你很惊奇伽马辐射读数正在下降，并松了一口气。因为在着陆过程中，你只需要担心的是过热了。
			#LOC_GPP_KerbalismGeiger_IcarusInSpaceHigh = 持续不断、中等强度的伽马射线从行星方向传来，而不是恒星那边，真有趣啊。
			#LOC_GPP_KerbalismGeiger_ThaliaSrfLanded = You detect a high amount of ambient radiation or at least confirm the presence of a lot of radioactive material within the crust.
			#LOC_GPP_KerbalismGeiger_ThaliaInSpaceLow = The compact magnetosphere shows more vivdly. Where you expect the radiation curve to dial down compared to Gael, it does not, and does so closer to the surface.
			#LOC_GPP_KerbalismGeiger_ThaliaInSpaceHigh = Does it get any scarier here, up close? You find a misshapened magnetic field after just beginning to come to terms with the unexplained and blistering ambient heat.
			#LOC_GPP_KerbalismGeiger_EtaSrfLanded = Geiger is chill. Eta is as chill while landed as while space.
			#LOC_GPP_KerbalismGeiger_EtaInSpaceLow = Nope. Nothing yet. You steele yourself with the anticipation that Eta might surprise with something deadly.
			#LOC_GPP_KerbalismGeiger_EtaInSpaceHigh = It astounds you that this moon dances right outside of a far larger deadly thing than the eyes can measure. Anyway it seems pretty safe here so break out the snacks!
			#LOC_GPP_KerbalismGeiger_NivenSrfLanded = It's safe to put away the foil wrappings but it's still a bad idea to strip down and step outside.
			#LOC_GPP_KerbalismGeiger_NivenFlyingLow = Geiger says it's safe to turn off the red lights now.
			#LOC_GPP_KerbalismGeiger_NivenFlyingHigh = Some space radiation persists here!
			#LOC_GPP_KerbalismGeiger_NivenInSpaceLow = Some deep analysis confirms that this planet's own radiation field is eroding its atmosphere!
			#LOC_GPP_KerbalismGeiger_NivenInSpaceHigh = The device registers a very unique radiation pattern with this planet. It's safe to assume from the look of things that the pattern is tied to the atmosphere.
			#LOC_GPP_KerbalismGeiger_GaelSrfLanded = Geiger sleeps. Though it may wiggle its toes if used near a concentration of Uraninite.
			#LOC_GPP_KerbalismGeiger_GaelFlyingLow = The device is enjoying the ride as much as you are. It forgets to be alert and registers nothing.
			#LOC_GPP_KerbalismGeiger_GaelFlyingHigh = The needle goes up but you wonder if it's measuring radiation or speed.
			#LOC_GPP_KerbalismGeiger_GaelInSpaceLow = You encounter powerful toroidal formations of deadly ionizing particles and wonder absolutely why is this here? ...And can engines be developed around them in the near future(tm)?
			#LOC_GPP_KerbalismGeiger_GaelInSpaceHigh = The space radiation is still very strong out here. It seems deterring... What if everywhere is like this?
			#LOC_GPP_KerbalismGeiger_IotaSrfLanded = The Geiger still rests. it's celebration time!
			#LOC_GPP_KerbalismGeiger_IotaInSpaceLow = It continues to appear very safe in Iotian space. Prepare the shovels. Droops Candy is clearly safe to eat.
			#LOC_GPP_KerbalismGeiger_IotaInSpaceHigh = The needle barely budges. That's a nice but dull entry for the logs.
			#LOC_GPP_KerbalismGeiger_CetiSrfLanded = Your suit ensures that you feel nothing...but it's just a little warm here.
			#LOC_GPP_KerbalismGeiger_CetiInSpaceLow = Since it twitched it has very steadily, very slowly risen. Ceti's looks aren't the only displeasing thing about it anymore.
			#LOC_GPP_KerbalismGeiger_CetiInSpaceHigh = The needle twitches. Geiger must have been slightly jarred by the sight of the moon.
			#LOC_GPP_KerbalismGeiger_TellumoSrfLanded = What's hot and cold at the same time? ....Tellumo.
			#LOC_GPP_KerbalismGeiger_TellumoFlyingLow = Unlike at Gael the needle still holds a very modest position above zero. Well dang, imagine what the surface is like.
			#LOC_GPP_KerbalismGeiger_TellumoFlyingHigh = The atmosphere, it burns! Forget the radioactive stuff!
			#LOC_GPP_KerbalismGeiger_TellumoInSpaceLow = The geiger pulls a high note. It's twice as bad here as around Gael!
			#LOC_GPP_KerbalismGeiger_TellumoInSpaceHigh = That same powerful irradiance from Gael meets you again. It makes you wonder if the ice is radioactive.
			#LOC_GPP_KerbalismGeiger_LiliSrfLanded = If ever you wanted to stick a bulb in a potato and watch it light up, now is the time!
			#LOC_GPP_KerbalismGeiger_LiliInSpaceLow = Lili's kinda... hot. Rimshot.
			#LOC_GPP_KerbalismGeiger_LiliInSpaceHigh = It's reasonably strong out here. Well it makes sense, there's no way this infant world can shield itself.
			#LOC_GPP_KerbalismGeiger_GratianSrfLanded = The needle rises. Depending on the mission goal you picked a good place to land...or not...
			#LOC_GPP_KerbalismGeiger_GratianFlyingLow = Red dust heavily gathers on the face of the instrument but doesn't block the data flow... yet.
			#LOC_GPP_KerbalismGeiger_GratianFlyingHigh = The sensors burn slightly but not from cosmic stuff.
			#LOC_GPP_KerbalismGeiger_GratianInSpaceLow = Spices themselves are kind of like deadly ionizing material. It just depends on where it gets to and if you can resist it long enough. That said, there's nothing to worry about yet plenty to write about the actual weird readouts here.
			#LOC_GPP_KerbalismGeiger_GratianInSpaceHigh = If we ever have to turn on the red lights we can save some battery and just angle the windows at Gratian. That said, it's perfctly safe to roll up the Aluminum.
			#LOC_GPP_KerbalismGeiger_GeminusSrfLanded = The lower you go the more the needle inches up. You wonder what the composition of the darker surface material is and can't discern whether Geminus is absorbing or emitting.
			#LOC_GPP_KerbalismGeiger_GeminusInSpaceLow = The irradiance is modest but clearly present. You wonder if it intervened in any way with Geminus' marvelous geography.
			#LOC_GPP_KerbalismGeiger_GeminusInSpaceHigh = Gratian's irregular field carries over here. You detect an unhampered stream of charged particles flowing past this moon and its parent.
			#LOC_GPP_KerbalismGeiger_OthoFlyingLow = Your ship is as yellow and white as the planet. Be happy. You've attained your membership in the yellow bodies club.
			#LOC_GPP_KerbalismGeiger_OthoFlyingHigh = Although you may be burning alive at this point, the unique irradiance pattern is very bold and is consistent with Otho's distance from Ciro.
			#LOC_GPP_KerbalismGeiger_OthoInSpaceLow = According to the geiger, it absolutely burns just to be here! Is this the weight of Otho's gaze? You find a window and carefully look out to see if its eye is indeed positioned in your general direction.
			#LOC_GPP_KerbalismGeiger_OthoInSpaceHigh = The readings seem particularly high here, higher than even at the largest gas giant. Why this is, warrants a direct run to the nearest science lab.
			#LOC_GPP_KerbalismGeiger_AugustusSrfLanded = You forget that there is a potential equal danger to being here as under any other foreign skies. Apart from an apparent lack of water, this place seems quite inviting. The geiger's lack of response seems to finally confirm this.
			#LOC_GPP_KerbalismGeiger_AugustusFlyingLow = The place gets as yellow and orange as anywhere will ever get. The instrument barely reacts so maybe the extreme color bias is the only actual threat to exposed sensory bits.
			#LOC_GPP_KerbalismGeiger_AugustusFlyingHigh = The geiger doesn't count... The atmosphere must help quite a lot to mitigate Otho's radiation.
			#LOC_GPP_KerbalismGeiger_AugustusInSpaceLow = As you approach you think more about what kind of reading you will find.
			#LOC_GPP_KerbalismGeiger_AugustusInSpaceHigh = You would think that maybe something was up, here, given the strong color, but surprise! It seems very safe.
			#LOC_GPP_KerbalismGeiger_HephaestusSrfLanded = The needle barely jumps but that means you can! Hephaestus does very well to deflect cosmic radiation, it seems!
			#LOC_GPP_KerbalismGeiger_HephaestusInSpaceLow = The needle flops loosely indicating the device has become defective. You consider searching here for metal in case some other bits of technology decide to show their wear.
			#LOC_GPP_KerbalismGeiger_HephaestusInSpaceHigh = The sharp transition from the radiation value outside this moon's SOI to 0 astounds you. There must be something here quite worth finding and mining the science out of.
			#LOC_GPP_KerbalismGeiger_JannahSrfLanded = The device rests again. Either it's passed out from fear or the battery is spoiled.
			#LOC_GPP_KerbalismGeiger_JannahInSpaceLow = The radiation 'down here' doesn't seem as scary or suspicious as up high.
			#LOC_GPP_KerbalismGeiger_JannahInSpaceHigh = You find a very suspicious cavity in the radiation belt here. To your surprise it's geosynchronous with that equally suspicious cavity in the face of the moon!
			#LOC_GPP_KerbalismGeiger_GaussFlyingLow = The glass cracks.
			#LOC_GPP_KerbalismGeiger_GaussFlyingHigh = You're able to separate ionizing radiation from scalding heat. Congratulations!
			#LOC_GPP_KerbalismGeiger_GaussInSpaceLow = Can you hear it? that's the sound of Van Allen Gaelan's ghost howling.
			#LOC_GPP_KerbalismGeiger_GaussInSpaceHigh = The needle jitters. You are extremely far but the immediate response seems like you're extremely near.
			#LOC_GPP_KerbalismGeiger_LokiSrfLanded = The Geiger is silent. It may be terrified after what happened on the way down.
			#LOC_GPP_KerbalismGeiger_LokiInSpaceLow = The needle sharply movs and jitters about. It's nearly enough to cause a panic but it stops as quickly as it started. Was it yet another genuine anomaly or is this moon living up to its name?
			#LOC_GPP_KerbalismGeiger_LokiInSpaceHigh = The geiger gives tiny but rhytmic readings. The sine waves almost resemble a comedic villain laughing.
			#LOC_GPP_KerbalismGeiger_CatullusSrfLanded = There seems to be some alpha decay even way down here. Since Catullus is a borderline gas planet it all works out.
			#LOC_GPP_KerbalismGeiger_CatullusFlyingLow = There's so much purple you'd think the atmosphere itself mutated from exposure to itself.
			#LOC_GPP_KerbalismGeiger_CatullusFlyingHigh = The atmosphere is tangy with a weak saturation of radiation. Compared to Gael it's a small deal.
			#LOC_GPP_KerbalismGeiger_CatullusInSpaceLow = The Geiger coasts on higher numbers. You know that stuff is about to get real.
			#LOC_GPP_KerbalismGeiger_CatullusInSpaceHigh = Radiation level is rather high. Catullus clearly has plenty to be scared about.
			#LOC_GPP_KerbalismGeiger_TarsissSrfLanded = The barometer no longer distracts you, but its own readout on landing, lingering in your mind, does continue to distract.
			#LOC_GPP_KerbalismGeiger_TarsissFlyingLow = Your attention is torn between reading this device and staring at the barometer.
			#LOC_GPP_KerbalismGeiger_TarsissFlyingHigh = The device still dos not signal any presence of harmful radiation. You wonder again if it's broken.
			#LOC_GPP_KerbalismGeiger_TarsissInSpaceLow = The Geiger rests.
			#LOC_GPP_KerbalismGeiger_TarsissInSpaceHigh = Radiation level is nill. You suspect that Tarsiss has its own healthy magnetosphere.
			#LOC_GPP_KerbalismGeiger_NeroFlyingLow = Radiation levels just keep climbing. While you need more than just Shielding in order to survive long enough to escape from here, the readings make for epic science and an epic story to tell the grandkids.
			#LOC_GPP_KerbalismGeiger_NeroFlyingHigh = Nero's heartbeat is very evident. This planet is quite alive. Look at all those digits on the screen! Yeah, those on the thermometer too!
			#LOC_GPP_KerbalismGeiger_NeroInSpaceLow = The needles fly up and dance about very lively, though not as much as it did at Otho.
			#LOC_GPP_KerbalismGeiger_NeroInSpaceHigh = You detect a spike. Even at the edge of this immense SOI a modest amount is registered and displayed by the Geiger. The king indeed throws his weight around.
			#LOC_GPP_KerbalismGeiger_HadrianSrfLanded = The Geiger is frozen and does not respond.
			#LOC_GPP_KerbalismGeiger_HadrianFlyingLow = You ponder whether possibly, any radiation at this point may be a sign of proximity to Nero's heavenly Snack Bar.
			#LOC_GPP_KerbalismGeiger_HadrianFlyingHigh = There's still no radiation, but you do confirm the coldness as the cockpit glass glazes over.
			#LOC_GPP_KerbalismGeiger_HadrianInSpaceLow = You know, this moon looks like it's made of ice. Maybe it's so cold that alpha decay is halted.
			#LOC_GPP_KerbalismGeiger_HadrianInSpaceHigh = There's no radiation here... But there's a lot of photo opportunity.
			#LOC_GPP_KerbalismGeiger_NarisseSrfLanded = No evidence of radiation still. Now if Narisse was indeed an edible celestial there'd be no fear of getting epic indigestion.
			#LOC_GPP_KerbalismGeiger_NarisseInSpaceLow = Still nothing... But still a worthy entry for the archives.
			#LOC_GPP_KerbalismGeiger_NarisseInSpaceHigh = You detect nothing; an appropriate expctation of a moon that's barely there.
			#LOC_GPP_KerbalismGeiger_MuseSrfLanded = The readings are nominal. This makes an okay entry to the logs.
			#LOC_GPP_KerbalismGeiger_MuseInSpaceLow = You're able to focus this time and you record the readings, which are technically none.
			#LOC_GPP_KerbalismGeiger_MuseInSpaceHigh = You find yourself thinking a lot of things. Unfortunately none of these include the actual readout of the Geiger, but fortunately it wouldn't have mattered.
			#LOC_GPP_KerbalismGeiger_MinonaSrfLanded = You experience a fair bit of disllusionment. Landed, the radiance seems to vanish. The Geiger would smirk about now if it was alive...like the Mystery Goo.
			#LOC_GPP_KerbalismGeiger_MinonaInSpaceLow = Her radiance increases as you get closer. The sentiment is not mutual, however, as the Geiger shows no response whatsoever.
			#LOC_GPP_KerbalismGeiger_MinonaInSpaceHigh = You find Minona particularly radiant. Maybe not in a harmful way like you expect, but still.
			#LOC_GPP_KerbalismGeiger_HoxSrfLanded = The Geiger rests. Again...
			#LOC_GPP_KerbalismGeiger_HoxFlyingLow = You get no response from the Geiger. It brings some comfort in that the climate here doesn't add to the amount of natural hazards.
			#LOC_GPP_KerbalismGeiger_HoxFlyingHigh = The needle keeps jittering. It's hard to tell whether it's colder in space, or in this sky, or whether the sky is surprisingly radioactive.
			#LOC_GPP_KerbalismGeiger_HoxInSpaceLow = The Geiger jitters slightly. You wonder if there's an erratic property here or even the machinefeels cold.
			#LOC_GPP_KerbalismGeiger_HoxInSpaceHigh = The ambient radiation levels don't change. This is both a good sign anda bad one.
			#LOC_GPP_KerbalismGeiger_ArgoSrfLanded = The Geiger continues to show no interesting numbers. That means one very good thing... The water has one more good reason to pump straight into the ship and drink in a few minutes!
			#LOC_GPP_KerbalismGeiger_ArgoInSpaceLow = The colors and textures distract you from reading the device. When you remember to do so, apparently the values declare that it's completely safe.
			#LOC_GPP_KerbalismGeiger_ArgoInSpaceHigh = No interesting or emphasized numbers arise. It's a good thing too, as that would show Argo to actually be just another deadly siren in space.
			#LOC_GPP_KerbalismGeiger_LetoSrfLanded = Radiation levels are very minor and noteworthy to the device. This anomalous turnout prompts the use of more science experiments.
			#LOC_GPP_KerbalismGeiger_LetoInSpaceLow = The readings are soft but erratic and noisy, indicating the presence of a peculiar factor, but not indicating the presence of a clear danger.
			#LOC_GPP_KerbalismGeiger_LetoInSpaceHigh = Readings are as average as they get, however, knowing how far you are from Gael, you anticipate quite a different experience once you go far enough beyond this planetoid.
			#LOC_GPP_KerbalismGeiger_GrannusSrfLanded = The radiation level is over 9000 times 9000!
			#LOC_GPP_KerbalismGeiger_GrannusFlyingLow = Son of True Kraken!
			#LOC_GPP_KerbalismGeiger_GrannusFlyingHigh = The Geiger screams in absolute terror and agony!
			#LOC_GPP_KerbalismGeiger_GrannusInSpaceLow = The radiation levels are surprisingly strong here. So much of it is in InfraRed rather than in UltraViolet and Gamma. Now this is science!
			#LOC_GPP_KerbalismGeiger_GrannusInSpaceHigh = After discovering the increased plights of the interstellar medium, the device's numbers coast at a lower and steady nominal, but still higher than within Ciro's heliopause. Maybe the differences in wavelengths and saturation are a reflection of Grannus' sheer age.

		//GPP/GPP_Configs/GPP_LaunchSites.cfg (also used in GPP_RemoteTech.cfg)
			#LOC_GPP_SpaceCenters_name1 = GSC Main
			#LOC_GPP_SpaceCenters_description1 = The main location of Gael's GSC. It sits upon a tiny isle adjacent to a crown-like mountain range at the edge of its mainland, and which includes a volcano.
			#LOC_GPP_SpaceCenters_name2 = Point Spetses
			#LOC_GPP_SpaceCenters_description2 = A peninsula like location that protrudes Westward and and is very near to the frosty Tundra. It's ramp-like appearance while viewed from Mesosphere can be quite invigorating in the eyes of inbound pilots.
			#LOC_GPP_SpaceCenters_name3 = Cironauts's Hope
			#LOC_GPP_SpaceCenters_description3 = The GSC is positioned near a natural bridge between a great lake in the North, and ocean.
			#LOC_GPP_SpaceCenters_name4 = Northern Valley
			#LOC_GPP_SpaceCenters_description4 = At this location the GSC occupies a midland patch near a valley that once was dry but has become a great lake. This lake is not in sight from the GSC, however. Launch off the runway here and be prepared for a beautiful sight.
			#LOC_GPP_SpaceCenters_name5 = Rook's Glory
			#LOC_GPP_SpaceCenters_description5 = An equatorial, seaside location. This is the most forgiving option for newer Gaelean rocketeers.
			#LOC_GPP_SpaceCenters_name6 = Southern Site
			#LOC_GPP_SpaceCenters_description6 = Southern Site is an alternate launch site.
			#LOC_GPP_SpaceCenters_name7 = DomRok
			#LOC_GPP_SpaceCenters_description7 = DomRok is a large island, and the highest point thereof, in the Mid-West with nearly equal and opposite inclination to the default location. GSC becomes the Island Base.
			#LOC_GPP_SpaceCenters_name8 = Broken Arrow
			#LOC_GPP_SpaceCenters_description8 = In the early years of rocketry, Broken Arrow was a state-of-the-art launchsite. Today, it is used mostly as a bridge to avoid comms black out between Rooks Glory and GSC Main, and as an occasional launch site for the lucky enthusiast that gets clearance to launch.

		//GPP/GPP_Configs/GPP_ResearchBodies.cfg
			#autoLOC_RBodies_discover_Icarus = The likes of a spherical oyster or other mollusk is found in the sky. Mmm, oysters... Oh, wait, we're looking for planets. Let's name it Icarus!
			#autoLOC_RBodies_discover_Thalia = Holy-- what in the kraken?! It's horrible! It's terrifying!!! The obeservatory team evacuates. Thalia winks in satifaction.
			#autoLOC_RBodies_discover_Eta = A twinkling white glimmer emerges from behind the big, scary red glimmer. Eta, the fairest moon of all graces the archives.
			#autoLOC_RBodies_discover_Niven = Something about that big bright orange inspires sweets. The observatory team bets it will be sweet to go there. Pack extra ice, guys! We're going to Niven!
			#autoLOC_RBodies_discover_Tellumo = Intensity has never intensified like it does right now. With the tiniest of zoom-in, Tellumo's image becomes crystal clear.
			#autoLOC_RBodies_discover_Lili = You find a little sparkle racing around Tellumo, otherwise hiding well in its rings... Is this thing drunk on sugar?
			#autoLOC_RBodies_discover_Gratian = Looks like we found a giant peach, said James B. Gaelan.
			#autoLOC_RBodies_discover_Geminus = A white light begins to change direction and move the opposite way, towards a peach colored one. It must be a real gem of a moon; Hello, Geminus!
			#autoLOC_RBodies_discover_Otho = After watching for a solid few minutes the observatory team's gaze catches the giant. And the team panicks...apparently the giant's gaze has caught them!
			#autoLOC_RBodies_discover_Augustus = An orange light steals the show. It's confirmed to have a thick atmosphere. Space tourism just went to the next, next level.
			#autoLOC_RBodies_discover_Hephaestus = Woah. This moon is really small. We didn't expect to find it, honestly but we're glad it is where it is. Now, where's the trail mix?
			#autoLOC_RBodies_discover_Jannah = You see Jannah. But she sees you too and proceeds to flee behind Otho. Is it worth it to chase this moon?
			#autoLOC_RBodies_discover_Gauss = Behind a strong blue light further ahead, the team discovers...another gas giant? Other instruments promptly lock onto the presence of an enormous magnetic field. There's so much of it that a team member names the giant for it. We have ourselves a giant named Gauss.
			#autoLOC_RBodies_discover_Catullus = There's a big purple thing out there... Yes, purple! "Catullus," said Jade J Gaelan, a lead scientist who happens by as this discovery occurs. It's as if he was waiting for this moment.
			#autoLOC_RBodies_discover_Loki = "Trololol~Lo'lo'lololo~" Loki sings manically as he dances clear into view and into everyone's memories. For better or for worse.
			#autoLOC_RBodies_discover_Tarsiss = When you see a little dot circling a big dot of the same color you know it's something. And Tarsiss is that something.
			#autoLOC_RBodies_discover_Nero = The optics confirm a gas giant in the most vast of distances. No words are found to describe it. Nero the great, and his wide, inclined rings cause everyone to drop their jaw or sink to their knees.
			#autoLOC_RBodies_discover_Hadrian = Sensors detect what appears to be a strawberry with whipped cream on top. We elect to name it Hadrian, just in case it is not.
			#autoLOC_RBodies_discover_Minona = Ooooh. Pretty moon. Do you thinkit's Nero's wife or his daughter. Let's ask her. Minona! Hey, Minona!
			#autoLOC_RBodies_discover_Muse = Now, this is the most intriguing thing we've ever found. Look at those deltas! The observatory team finds itself musing for an excessive amount of time over it. Therefore, a poetically inclined Gaelean decides to name it Muse.
			#autoLOC_RBodies_discover_Narisse = The one scientist on duty at the time returns from obtaining caramel chocolate snacks. Somehow he spots the tiny Narisse, who looks just like those snacks.... Whoa.
			#autoLOC_RBodies_discover_Hox = You find a pale orange entity near the edge of the telescope's ES range. Is it the farthest one? Who knows. But you do know that its probably an ice planet. Planet Hox.
			#autoLOC_RBodies_discover_Argo = After studying for enough time, that one twinkle moving like the electron in a Hydrogen atom, you finally spot the siren, Argo.
			#autoLOC_RBodies_discover_Leto = Hold up. Is that an ice cream scoop in space??? Oh, it's Leto! But Leto's so far away! Maybe it's indeed an ice cream scoop. Maybe it has sprinkles?
			#autoLOC_RBodies_discover_Grannus = The Gaelean Historians have record of a red light called Grannus, that opened wide at us nearly 2000 years ago and then retreated. They could do with a less lofty vocabulary... But maybe they were talking about this star here.

			//Discovery Fail Messages
			@#autoLOC_RBodies_00052:AFTER[ResearchBodies] = Hey, look! ...Oh wait. That's a rogue pixel. The screen is dying.
			@#autoLOC_RBodies_00053:AFTER[ResearchBodies] = We see a whole lot of colour but that's just our galaxy itself.
			@#autoLOC_RBodies_00054:AFTER[ResearchBodies] = Survey says... Nah.
			@#autoLOC_RBodies_00055:AFTER[ResearchBodies] = There's nothing on our sensors, captain.

			#LOC_GPP_ScienceDefs_SurfaceSample_default = The material here is curious. Unfortunately its composition eludes you and your mind drifts toward the shiny part.
			#LOC_GPP_ScienceDefs_SurfaceSample_GaelSrfLandedTundra = Frosty mud and dead grass... It personally displeases you but it will make for good science.
			#LOC_GPP_ScienceDefs_SurfaceSample_GaelSrfLandedIceCaps = You immediately feel a fair portion of the coldness in your hand as you scoop it. Your suit's integrity has been challenged.
			#LOC_GPP_ScienceDefs_SurfaceSample_GaelSrfLandedMinorShores = You pick up something that seems non-living -- a mollusk or coral. It offers you its science.

			#LOC_GPP_ScienceDefs_SurfaceSample_GaelSrfLandedPligiaShores = You find something grass-like but it confounds you. Is this actually grass?
			#LOC_GPP_ScienceDefs_SurfaceSample_GaelSrfLandedEucriaShores = You find intriguing uncommon materials in the gritty and or loose material around you. You get that science. You get it!

			#LOC_GPP_ScienceDefs_SurfaceSample_GaelSrfLandedVolcano = The ground is full of very dark, igneous materials. It's not brittle but it leaves black dusty stains on your hands.
			#LOC_GPP_ScienceDefs_SurfaceSample_GaelSrfLandedMountains = The instrumentation determines nothing special in the rocks here. But you make a note to go hiking on your next vacation.
			#LOC_GPP_ScienceDefs_SurfaceSample_GaelSrfLandedHighlands = We cannae give 'er anymahr' cap'n. The highlands cannae take it!
			#LOC_GPP_ScienceDefs_SurfaceSample_GaelSrfLandedMidlands = You envision a time where thousands of Gaeleans have spread across the quaint midlands creating Gaelean surburbia and shiver in horror.
			#LOC_GPP_ScienceDefs_SurfaceSample_GaelSrfLandedLowlands = Roses are red, violets are blue. The grass is green and so are you. Wait...
			#LOC_GPP_ScienceDefs_SurfaceSample_GaelSrfLandedReefs = You manage to catch something that's hard on the outside but alive. It makes a chirping noise or flicks something at you but it also offers some science.
			#LOC_GPP_ScienceDefs_SurfaceSample_GaelSrfLandedInlandWater = The sand has many textures but is mostly wet. It holds your interest and makes you hold more of it. For science of course.
			#LOC_GPP_ScienceDefs_SurfaceSample_GaelSrfLandedWater = The water is particularly messy here, especially when it's shallow enough to walk in and hence you raise sand in it by treading.
			#LOC_GPP_ScienceDefs_SurfaceSample_GaelSrfSplashedMinorShores = You pick up something smooth and wriggly. It's not a particularly gross thing so you happily science it.
			#LOC_GPP_ScienceDefs_SurfaceSample_GaelSrfSplashedUakoraShores = You manage to catch an organism with your water sample. You throw it back because sciencing it is for another team of scientists.
			#LOC_GPP_ScienceDefs_SurfaceSample_GaelSrfSplashedPligiaShores = You find that the water carries a strong odor and is not fit for drinking. You wonder how the things that live in it live.
			#LOC_GPP_ScienceDefs_SurfaceSample_GaelSrfSplashedEucriaShores = You manage to catch an organism with your water sample. You throw it out with a frown, knowing you won't have the time or permission to mind pets.
			#LOC_GPP_ScienceDefs_SurfaceSample_GaelSrfSplashedGoonieShores = //blank b/c no def written yet
			#LOC_GPP_ScienceDefs_SurfaceSample_GaelSrfSplashedReefs = The sample contains sediments not found in other biomes. This fascinates you.
			#LOC_GPP_ScienceDefs_SurfaceSample_GaelSrfSplashedInlandWater = Compared to sea water, this sure seems thirst-quenching. But there are still things operating in it, other than you.
			#LOC_GPP_ScienceDefs_SurfaceSample_GaelSrfSplashedWater = You find a great abundance of one or more elements that would please both chemists and hobbyist builders. The administration may be pleased with this find.
			#LOC_GPP_ScienceDefs_SurfaceSample_IotaSrfLandedSkids = You grab at the pale, sandy surface and wonder if it is sugar, salt or spice.
			#LOC_GPP_ScienceDefs_SurfaceSample_IotaSrfLandedHighlands = The pale and soft texture makes many snacks come to mind. You eagerly hope that R&D confirms that this moon was made for munching.
			#LOC_GPP_ScienceDefs_SurfaceSample_IotaSrfLandedMidlands = It's mildly tanned and hard to break a piece off of. But you nail it. The challenging sample screams 'fudge' at you.
			#LOC_GPP_ScienceDefs_SurfaceSample_IotaSrfLandedLowlands = The surface happens to yield easily in your grasp. You stow the piece and ponder over another one. For science, of course.
			#LOC_GPP_ScienceDefs_SurfaceSample_IotaSrfLandedDroops = The crystalline soil challenges you to draw a pick axe. Since you came fully prepared the soil loses.
			#LOC_GPP_ScienceDefs_SurfaceSample_CetiSrfLandedPlateaus = It's pale, its gritty, it's easy to scoop up and therefore, has been. Easy science.
			#LOC_GPP_ScienceDefs_SurfaceSample_CetiSrfLandedHighlands = The pale crust of this moon proves difficult to break a piece off of with your hands. You bet it will, however, easily surrender to your teeth.
			#LOC_GPP_ScienceDefs_SurfaceSample_CetiSrfLandedMidlands = The soft, colored soil crumbles easily and finds a place in a sample jar.
			#LOC_GPP_ScienceDefs_SurfaceSample_CetiSrfLandedLowlands = You take up a fragment of the dark and oddly colored soil. You find find the blend of colors as gross up close as from any great distance, but you store it anyway.
			#LOC_GPP_ScienceDefs_SurfaceSample_CetiSrfLandedPoles = You scrape up some of the muddy material. It oddly seems like caramel and is deemed quite worthy of the storage space on the ship.
			//------------------------------
			#LOC_GPP_ScienceDefs_CrewReport_default = You make notes. It's about wherever you're at. They're really interesting. Can I read them?
			#LOC_GPP_ScienceDefs_CrewReport_GaelInSpaceHigh = The extreme weightlessness makes the crew ponder things they normally wouldn't...like how long it would take to have snacks delivered to this height.
			#LOC_GPP_ScienceDefs_CrewReport_GaelInSpaceLow = The clouds once mocked you with their altitude and speed... My, how the tables have turned!
			#LOC_GPP_ScienceDefs_CrewReport_GaelFlyingHigh = You wish you had binoculars. It would be cool to try to spot the GSC with them.
			#LOC_GPP_ScienceDefs_CrewReport_GaelFlyingLowTundra = Is... is that snow?!
			#LOC_GPP_ScienceDefs_CrewReport_GaelFlyingLowIceCaps = The crew takes notice of the extraordinarily high amount of white below.
			#LOC_GPP_ScienceDefs_CrewReport_GaelFlyingLowMinorShores = Flying low over the shore lines allows you to spot schools of fish, frothy dessert-like white caps and OH KRAKEN SAVE US THAT'S A BIG FREAKING SHARK!!!
			#LOC_GPP_ScienceDefs_CrewReport_GaelFlyingLowUakoraShores = The blended colors and swirls of colors within the colors off this shoreline make you think of numerous candies and puddings.
			#LOC_GPP_ScienceDefs_CrewReport_GaelFlyingLowPligiaShores = Even with altitude the colors of the shore line blend with each other in such a way that makes your eyes dance and unable to focus properly.
			#LOC_GPP_ScienceDefs_CrewReport_GaelFlyingLowEucriaShores = The beauty of the Eucria Shores can be seen from any altitude kind of like your neighbor and a good pair of binoculars. OH SCRATCH THAT! ERASE, REWIND, SOMETHING!
			#LOC_GPP_ScienceDefs_CrewReport_GaelFlyingLowVolcano = If this thing erupts now would you get a ribbon for that? First Gaelean to be Forced EVA by a Volcano?
			#LOC_GPP_ScienceDefs_CrewReport_GaelFlyingLowMountains = Climb faster. CLIMB faster! CLIMB FASTER!!!! Did the altimeter catch that? Hopefully no one reviews the black box.
			#LOC_GPP_ScienceDefs_CrewReport_GaelFlyingLowHighlands = Whole flocks of sheep appear to be fleeing a large number of Gaeleans in kilts.
			#LOC_GPP_ScienceDefs_CrewReport_GaelFlyingLowMidlands = Flat. Featureless. Suburbs. Boring.
			#LOC_GPP_ScienceDefs_CrewReport_GaelFlyingLowLowlands = The scientist in you tells you to concentrate on making notes regarding feature surfaces from altitude...the pilot in you eyes the wide open spaces and daydreams of extra wide landing strips.
			#LOC_GPP_ScienceDefs_CrewReport_GaelFlyingLowReefs = You see extraordinarily green land in some places above sea level, but you also see land that's just barely below sea level.
			#LOC_GPP_ScienceDefs_CrewReport_GaelFlyingLowInlandWater = You kontemplate bringing a dinghy and some friends to party here next time the space program eases up for vacations.
			#LOC_GPP_ScienceDefs_CrewReport_GaelFlyingLowWater = There are so many colorful living things under the blue surface. If they have eyes they must surely be looking up in envy now.
			#LOC_GPP_ScienceDefs_CrewReport_GaelSrfLandedTundra = Well you thought the surface was solid anyway...now you're stuck up to the top of the gear struts in frozen, slushy mud. Good luck with that!
			#LOC_GPP_ScienceDefs_CrewReport_GaelSrfLandedIceCaps = You monitor the surroundings for an extended period of time. You realize that Ciro avoids the horizon and that the time of day does not change.
			#LOC_GPP_ScienceDefs_CrewReport_GaelSrfLandedMinorShores = As you were coming in to land you swear you just saw a shark attacking a boat right off the coast...
			#LOC_GPP_ScienceDefs_CrewReport_GaelSrfLandedUakoraShores = Swirlieeeessssss.....
			#LOC_GPP_ScienceDefs_CrewReport_GaelSrfLandedPligiaShores = The mixed colors of Pilgia makes you wonder if the GSC guys would mind you using the science cam for some selfies.
			#LOC_GPP_ScienceDefs_CrewReport_GaelSrfLandedEucriaShores = Eucria is beautiful, flat, colorful, easy to land on and inviting. Everything any good pilot looks for in a landing strip.
			#LOC_GPP_ScienceDefs_CrewReport_GaelSrfLandedVolcano = Someone grumbles about the volcano waking. You politely express your disinterest in that.
			#LOC_GPP_ScienceDefs_CrewReport_GaelSrfLandedMountains = This landing was pretty scary. Let's not do this again...
			#LOC_GPP_ScienceDefs_CrewReport_GaelSrfLandedHighlands = In the highlands, Gaeleans are Real Gaeleans but sheep are nervous.
			#LOC_GPP_ScienceDefs_CrewReport_GaelSrfLandedMidlands = You often wonder if living in the Midlands would be equivalent to the suburbs. It just seems so...average.
			#LOC_GPP_ScienceDefs_CrewReport_GaelSrfLandedLowlands = You find that landing here rather than on a runway is much easier. You wonder why that is.
			#LOC_GPP_ScienceDefs_CrewReport_GaelSrfLandedReefs = Any landing you can walk away from is a good one. Here, though, is going to be a very tedious walk...if it's even possible to step away from the beauty of this place.
			#LOC_GPP_ScienceDefs_CrewReport_GaelSrfLandedInlandWater = After coming down from altitude you find this location to be a perfect vacation spot and make note of a nice piece of lakefront property while you're here...
			#LOC_GPP_ScienceDefs_CrewReport_GaelSrfLandedWater = Wait...isn't this supposed to SPLASHED in water? What's with the landing?
			#LOC_GPP_ScienceDefs_CrewReport_GaelSrfSplashed = The water's surface makes it hard to see down into it, but everyone agrees there's more than meets the eye.
			#LOC_GPP_ScienceDefs_CrewReport_GaelSrfSplashedMinorShores = Now that you've splashed down in the minor shores you begin to get nervous about those stories of giant sharks right off the coast.
			#LOC_GPP_ScienceDefs_CrewReport_GaelSrfSplashedUakoraShores = It's quite pleasing to see the geology and its radiant colors through the tint of the shallow water.
			#LOC_GPP_ScienceDefs_CrewReport_GaelSrfSplashedPligiaShores = Different than Uakora or Eucria, the colors of the corals of Pilgia makes you want to fingerpaint.
			#LOC_GPP_ScienceDefs_CrewReport_GaelSrfSplashedEucriaShores = Eucria has its own personality like the other minor shores of Gael. She happens to be single, green, loves rockets and wants to find a strong Gaelean to...oh wrong magazine.
			#LOC_GPP_ScienceDefs_CrewReport_GaelSrfSplashedReefs = Crashing and splashing just gotta whole lot better. Everyone becomes captivated by the scenery.
			#LOC_GPP_ScienceDefs_CrewReport_GaelSrfSplashedInlandWater = Look! Kritters!
			#LOC_GPP_ScienceDefs_CrewReport_GaelSrfSplashedWater = You take a brief dive down several meters and your sight is graced by flowery things and wriggly things passing by.
			#LOC_GPP_ScienceDefs_CrewReport_IotaInSpaceHigh = Pity that the ship's onboard imaging tools don't allow for Super-Ultra HD. Otherwise every pixel would be tasty.
			#LOC_GPP_ScienceDefs_CrewReport_IotaInSpaceLow = From this altitude it's easy to percieve an immeasurable load of tender sugary treat below.
			#LOC_GPP_ScienceDefs_CrewReport_IotaSrfLandedSkids = Dust raises and the legs/wheels sink gently in. An awesome find, but does it come with awesome taste?
			#LOC_GPP_ScienceDefs_CrewReport_IotaSrfLandedHighlands = A mild pillow-like sensation on landing is noted. Maybe the surface here is indeed similar to cotton-candy.
			#LOC_GPP_ScienceDefs_CrewReport_IotaSrfLandedMidlands = The landing is particularly soft and the immediate area is dark. It's okay, though, darker edibles tend to have more to them which is always good.
			#LOC_GPP_ScienceDefs_CrewReport_IotaSrfLandedLowlands = Touchdown! Everything seems nominal. Now where are the giant shovels? Mission Control is waiting for a piece of this as badly as you are.
			#LOC_GPP_ScienceDefs_CrewReport_IotaSrfLandedDroops = The surface cracks gently, and around the crack glimmers appear. Is this some kind of sparkly crystal delight?
			#LOC_GPP_ScienceDefs_CrewReport_CetiInspaceHigh = Captain's log: We have entered naked-eye range of the moon. It's pinkish brown, and rippled...and looks partially digested. End log.
			#LOC_GPP_ScienceDefs_CrewReport_CetiInSpaceLow = As the terrain darkens and cycles colors, so too does your attention span.
			#LOC_GPP_ScienceDefs_CrewReport_CetiSrfLandedPlateaus = A landing worthy of a wide smile and a good few ribbons. You hope the Final Frontier system is recording this for when you return.
			#LOC_GPP_ScienceDefs_CrewReport_CetiSrfLandedHighlands = You're reminded in many ways of the highlands of Gael. Minus the breathable atmosphere, pleasant temperatures and sheep being chased by Gaeleans in kilts.
			#LOC_GPP_ScienceDefs_CrewReport_CetiSrfLandedMidlands = Luckily being landed in this region allows you to temporarily put the rest of Ceti out of your mind as you gaze across the least digested landscape of this moon.
			#LOC_GPP_ScienceDefs_CrewReport_CetiSrfLandedLowlands = Why is it this color??? Just... Why?!
			#LOC_GPP_ScienceDefs_CrewReport_CetiSrfLandedPoles = The landing gear is slow to spring back after touchdown...kind of like when you stick your finger into the cake frosting.
			//------------------------------
			#LOC_GPP_ScienceDefs_EVAReport_default = Before departing please be sure your seat backs and tray tables are forward and pick up any trash around your area.
			#LOC_GPP_ScienceDefs_EVAReport_GaelInSpaceHigh = You oogle Gael. The view is fantabulous. But now she considers you a pervert.
			#LOC_GPP_ScienceDefs_EVAReport_GaelInSpaceLowTundra = When you make comments in your report about the dismal tundra region Gael asks you to try being cold, distant and barren and see just how far you get in life.
			#LOC_GPP_ScienceDefs_EVAReport_GaelInSpaceLowIceCaps = When you make a note about the light, white covering on the caps of Gael she gets irritated and berates you over age discrimination.
			#LOC_GPP_ScienceDefs_EVAReport_GaelInSpaceLowMinorShores = These shores are so tiny and beautiful - perfect in every way. Gael accepts your compliment gracefully...for once.
			#LOC_GPP_ScienceDefs_EVAReport_GaelInSpaceLowUakoraShores = It would be difficult to find a more strikingly beautiful place than the Uakora Shores and Gael knows it. You note the conceit present everywhere in the environment.
			#LOC_GPP_ScienceDefs_EVAReport_GaelInSpaceLowPligiaShores = You wish you had binoculars. It would be cool to try to spot the GSC with them.
			#LOC_GPP_ScienceDefs_EVAReport_GaelInSpaceLowEucriaShores = The Eucria Shore flew by so fast you barely had time to see them. Almost like Gael just flashed you intentionally to give you just a quick peak at her beauty.
			#LOC_GPP_ScienceDefs_EVAReport_GaelInSpaceLowGoonieShores = //blank b/c no def written yet
			#LOC_GPP_ScienceDefs_EVAReport_GaelInSpaceLowVolcano = You wonder if Gael would be insulted if you suggested to the geologists they try to come up with some sort of geologic bleamish cream to remove it...
			#LOC_GPP_ScienceDefs_EVAReport_GaelInSpaceLowMountains = The mountains don't like quite so threatening from this altitude. From here you feel perfectly comfortable sticking your tongue out at them and notating it in the report.
			#LOC_GPP_ScienceDefs_EVAReport_GaelInSpaceLowHighlands = MUST RESIST! CAAannn't....What do you call a highlands Gaelean with a sheep under both arms? A pimp. Mission Control is not pleased with your report.
			#LOC_GPP_ScienceDefs_EVAReport_GaelInSpaceLowMidlands = The midlands are really no more interesting from here than they were at the surface. Now is a great time to play with your jetpack thrusters. Do it!
			#LOC_GPP_ScienceDefs_EVAReport_GaelInSpaceLowLowlands = It's amazing how wide and flat the wide flat spaces of the lowlands appear from low orbit. It just so...wide...and flat.
			#LOC_GPP_ScienceDefs_EVAReport_GaelInSpaceLowReefs = From a low orbit the colors of the coral reefs along the coast weave into intricate colors and lovely swirlies. That is a scientific term by the way...swirlies.
			#LOC_GPP_ScienceDefs_EVAReport_GaelInSpaceLowInlandWater = As you pass over the recorded coordinates of the inland waterways you begin daydreaming of your last vacation with that Gaelean from...WAIT SCIENCE!
			#LOC_GPP_ScienceDefs_EVAReport_GaelInSpaceLowWater = THIS!!!! THIS IS THE ULTIMATE HIGH DIVE! Who wants to go first?
			#LOC_GPP_ScienceDefs_EVAReport_GaelFlyingHigh = If you suspected your stupidity meter had broken this just proves you were accurate in your suspicions.
			#LOC_GPP_ScienceDefs_EVAReport_GaelFlyingLowTundra = You thought flying would improve the view of this dismal area of the planet. You were wrong and you let your displeasure shine through in your report.
			#LOC_GPP_ScienceDefs_EVAReport_GaelFlyingLowIceCaps = Too much fluffy white stuff. Can't see.
			#LOC_GPP_ScienceDefs_EVAReport_GaelFlyingLowMinorShores = Hanging on for dear life over the minor shores and praying there aren't any sharks looking hungrily up at you makes it difficult to write your report.
			#LOC_GPP_ScienceDefs_EVAReport_GaelFlyingLowUakoraShores = The alluring shores of the Uakora region beckon you like a Gaelean seen through beer goggles. Don't make the mistake of thinking Gael is inviting you in...you'll just get slapped.
			#LOC_GPP_ScienceDefs_EVAReport_GaelFlyingLowPligiaShores = Until you checked your notes you weren't sure you actually made any as you flew past the Pilgia Shores. The beauty of the region nearly distracted you into missing it.
			#LOC_GPP_ScienceDefs_EVAReport_GaelFlyingLowEucriaShores = You were prepared this time. As you pass into the area around Eucria you frantically begin recording your notes as you cling to the outside of your craft.
			#LOC_GPP_ScienceDefs_EVAReport_GaelFlyingLowGoonieShores = //blank b/c no def written yet
			#LOC_GPP_ScienceDefs_EVAReport_GaelFlyingLowVolcano = You know...hanging around on the outside of a craft while flying over a volcano is a good way to get removed permanently from the flight rotation.
			#LOC_GPP_ScienceDefs_EVAReport_GaelFlyingLowMountains = You explode with Adrenaline, just like your ship explodes with Surface.
			#LOC_GPP_ScienceDefs_EVAReport_GaelFlyingLowHighlands = You must be from the highlands if you're willing to hang on to the outside of a craft just to take a look at it as you fly over.
			#LOC_GPP_ScienceDefs_EVAReport_GaelFlyingLowMidlands = The midlands are so boring that even hanging on to the outside of a craft in mid-flight isn't enough to get you excited about being here.
			#LOC_GPP_ScienceDefs_EVAReport_GaelFlyingLowLowlands = The wide, flat spaces of the lowlands calls to your landing gear. Unfortunate for you that you're hanging onto the outside of the craft...
			#LOC_GPP_ScienceDefs_EVAReport_GaelFlyingLowReefs = You thought hanging on to the outside of your craft in flight would be an excellent way to find a safe place to land on the reefs until your grip started slipping. You leave that bit out of your report.
			#LOC_GPP_ScienceDefs_EVAReport_GaelFlyingLowInlandWater = You make some random notes about the inland waterways as you frantically try getting some aerials of lakefront property you're interested in purchasing.
			#LOC_GPP_ScienceDefs_EVAReport_GaelFlyingLowWater = The wind whips the waves below you into white caps as it also frantically stuggles to yank you from your tenuous hold on the craft's exterior.
			#LOC_GPP_ScienceDefs_EVAReport_GaelSrfLandedTundra = Your apetite for this climate is particularly low. You fill your report with both objective analysis and personal displeasure.
			#LOC_GPP_ScienceDefs_EVAReport_GaelSrfLandedIceCaps = It's cold and mushy out here. Let's make snow angels and a snow-Gaelean.
			#LOC_GPP_ScienceDefs_EVAReport_GaelSrfLandedMinorShores = Try as you might, you can't help but constantly eye the water's edge looking for the tail-tale sign...
			#LOC_GPP_ScienceDefs_EVAReport_GaelSrfLandedUakoraShores = This portion of terrain is really nice. You wonder if Mission Control will let you strip down and take five.
			#LOC_GPP_ScienceDefs_EVAReport_GaelSrfLandedPligiaShores = It's more beautiful here than anywhere else... In the eyes of a Gaelean, anyway, who might never see high orbit.
			#LOC_GPP_ScienceDefs_EVAReport_GaelSrfLandedEucriaShores = You determine that it may be somewhat hazardous to tread here in a spacesuit.
			#LOC_GPP_ScienceDefs_EVAReport_GaelSrfLandedGoonieShores = //blank b/c no def written yet
			#LOC_GPP_ScienceDefs_EVAReport_GaelSrfLandedVolcano = Standing here on the face of the massive geological zit you can't help but wonder if you squeezed just right...
			#LOC_GPP_ScienceDefs_EVAReport_GaelSrfLandedMountains = You declare yourself King Of The Hill.
			#LOC_GPP_ScienceDefs_EVAReport_GaelSrfLandedHighlands = You utter things in a Scottish accent, then you log them, then it's not as awesome anymore.
			#LOC_GPP_ScienceDefs_EVAReport_GaelSrfLandedMidlands = Welcome to Kurburbia!
			#LOC_GPP_ScienceDefs_EVAReport_GaelSrfLandedLowlands = "Did anyone pack bacon or eggs?" You ask as you get this brilliant idea for an experiment.
			#LOC_GPP_ScienceDefs_EVAReport_GaelSrfLandedReefs = It's quite pleasing to stand here and gaze at the highly colorful scenery. You begin to write elaborate notes.
			#LOC_GPP_ScienceDefs_EVAReport_GaelSrfLandedInlandWater = Ok. So here we go again. Landed. Water. LANDED!?
			#LOC_GPP_ScienceDefs_EVAReport_GaelSrfLandedWater = Ok. So here we go again. Landed. Water. LANDED!?
			#LOC_GPP_ScienceDefs_EVAReport_GaelSrfSplashedMinorShores = 1...2...3...4...5...6...you stop counting. Numerous fins are cicling your craft and you can see vicious rows of teeth grinning up at you from just below the water's surface.
			#LOC_GPP_ScienceDefs_EVAReport_GaelSrfSplashedUakoraShores = Well now you've done it. You've forced your way into Gael's Uakora Shores and she is not pleased. Many crabs come out to greet you as you exit the vehicle.
			#LOC_GPP_ScienceDefs_EVAReport_GaelSrfSplashedPligiaShores = You make a much nicer entry and landing in the waters of Pilgia and Gael rewards you for your gentleness with beautiful science.
			#LOC_GPP_ScienceDefs_EVAReport_GaelSrfSplashedEucriaShores = The jagged reefs of Eucria jut up out of the water all around you. Frankly you're amazed you landed without damaging something on the craft.
			#LOC_GPP_ScienceDefs_EVAReport_GaelSrfSplashedGoonieShores = //blank b/c no def written yet
			#LOC_GPP_ScienceDefs_EVAReport_GaelSrfSplashedReefs = You see lots of land right under you, and several little things floating about; some obviously alive, others' not obviously alive.
			#LOC_GPP_ScienceDefs_EVAReport_GaelSrfSplashedInlandWater = It's like being in space but really wet and tedious to turn and move.
			#LOC_GPP_ScienceDefs_EVAReport_GaelSrfSplashedWater = The water waves at you... Ba dum tiss.
			#LOC_GPP_ScienceDefs_EVAReport_IotaInSpaceHigh = You extend an arm and point at the biome, calling it out by visually familiar snacks rather than by aproper name.
			#LOC_GPP_ScienceDefs_EVAReport_IotaInSpaceLowSkids = Dust bowl. You've been informed by the GSC to expect large amounts of dust from this region and from space the depressed region make you think of a bowl. The scientists should love that analysis.
			#LOC_GPP_ScienceDefs_EVAReport_IotaInSpaceLowHighlands = You imagine a vast field of cotton candy could appear the same as the geographic region below you. You estimate there could be several trillion tons of the sweet sticky down there!
			#LOC_GPP_ScienceDefs_EVAReport_IotaInSpaceLowMidlands = The dark blotches representing the Midlands seem like the tastiest part, not necesarily of candy. You're tempted to have your vessel immediately descend to confirm this.
			#LOC_GPP_ScienceDefs_EVAReport_IotaInSpaceLowLowlands = You discern a sort of glaze effect on the surface below. It reminds you of juice that has begun to freeze solid.
			#LOC_GPP_ScienceDefs_EVAReport_IotaInSpaceLowDroops = Your eyes traverse the length of the Droops and linger rather long at it. But then you look away remembering that Gael took offense to the same thing.
			#LOC_GPP_ScienceDefs_EVAReport_IotaSrfLandedSkids = More loose dust greets you than anywhere else on Iota. You make a note to suggest R&D install windshield wipers on helmets.
			#LOC_GPP_ScienceDefs_EVAReport_IotaSrfLandedHighlands = Your feet sink into the mushy ground. For an instant you fear for your life. Afterwards, you ask if the parlour has something like this.
			#LOC_GPP_ScienceDefs_EVAReport_IotaSrfLandedMidlands = A feeling of guilt overcomes you as you set foot on what might possibly indeed be food. Who walks on food, anyway?
			#LOC_GPP_ScienceDefs_EVAReport_IotaSrfLandedLowlands = You find that the ground resembles bread.
			#LOC_GPP_ScienceDefs_EVAReport_IotaSrfLandedDroops = The crystalline dark treat goodness doesn't get any better, any closer than this! Oh wait. Yes it does.
			#LOC_GPP_ScienceDefs_EVAReport_CetiInspaceHigh = In space... no one can hear you puke.
			#LOC_GPP_ScienceDefs_EVAReport_CetiInSpaceLowPlateaus = You find excitement in the presence of flat areas on this moon. And then everyone else follows suit when they read this later.
			#LOC_GPP_ScienceDefs_EVAReport_CetiInSpaceLowHighlands = Someone, somewhere, is cracking a stale Highlander joke... This time it's not you.
			#LOC_GPP_ScienceDefs_EVAReport_CetiInSpaceLowMidlands = The low altitude over the midlands is one of the better views you have since it dominates your field of view obscuring the more digested regions of the moon and allowing you a brief respite.
			#LOC_GPP_ScienceDefs_EVAReport_CetiInSpaceLowLowlands = Fond memories, this view will not make.
			#LOC_GPP_ScienceDefs_EVAReport_CetiInSpaceLowPoles = You find it really hard to tell whether that brown stuff is good to eat or good to recycle or good fertilizer.
			#LOC_GPP_ScienceDefs_EVAReport_CetiSrfLandedPlateaus = The almost perfectly flat surface of the plateaus causes much joy and celebration amongst the scientists and engineers of the GSC and you've already begun hearing the rumblings of construction plans.
			#LOC_GPP_ScienceDefs_EVAReport_CetiSrfLandedHighlands = Gaeleans from the Highlands sent along their version of a space kilt for your EVA. Unfortunately it was unusable as they forgot to include the air tight underwear needed to survive without atmosphere.
			#LOC_GPP_ScienceDefs_EVAReport_CetiSrfLandedMidlands = Although this place looked like cotton candy from afar, remembering what everywhere else looks like bursts your bubble.
			#LOC_GPP_ScienceDefs_EVAReport_CetiSrfLandedLowlands = Eww... That is all.
			#LOC_GPP_ScienceDefs_EVAReport_CetiSrfLandedPoles = Several emotions register as you set foot on the mud-like surface.
			//------------------------------
			#LOC_GPP_ScienceDefs_MysteryGoo_default = GOO GOO G'JOOB!
			#LOC_GPP_ScienceDefs_MysteryGoo_GaelInSpaceHigh = The goo floats about in a perfect sphere. Ripple motions proceed along the Radial vector from the Gael-facing side to the backside. It doesn't get more fascinating than this... Or does it?
			#LOC_GPP_ScienceDefs_MysteryGoo_GaelInSpaceLow = The goo floats about leisurely in the form of a perfect tetrahedron until you look at it and then it quickly reverts to a random blob shape almost anticipating your attention. Spooky.
			#LOC_GPP_ScienceDefs_MysteryGoo_GaelFlyingHigh = The goo sprouts wings! ...Then it quickly retracts them.
			#LOC_GPP_ScienceDefs_MysteryGoo_GaelFlyingLow = The goo hangs out of its container like a kanine. Droplets escape into the distance but the goo seems not to mind... Maybe you should close the container now.
			#LOC_GPP_ScienceDefs_MysteryGoo_GaelSrfLandedTundra = The goo shivers. It must be too familiar with temperate climates.
			#LOC_GPP_ScienceDefs_MysteryGoo_GaelSrfLandedIceCaps = The goo takes on the form of a pair of candy canes. You wonder if it's safe to eat them. As if sensing your thoughts the goo first shakes side to side and then assumes it's original form.
			#LOC_GPP_ScienceDefs_MysteryGoo_GaelSrfLandedMinorShores = The goo is quite mellow here. It sunbathes and starts to sparkle.
			#LOC_GPP_ScienceDefs_MysteryGoo_GaelSrfLandedUakoraShores = The goo reaches out. Maybe it wants to tread on the beach.
			#LOC_GPP_ScienceDefs_MysteryGoo_GaelSrfLandedPligiaShores = You see wave patterns on the surface of, and inside of the goo. You grab a radar sensor as quickly as you can but it goes quiescent before you return.
			#LOC_GPP_ScienceDefs_MysteryGoo_GaelSrfLandedEucriaShores = You open the canister. There appears to be...another door to open? Oh it's playing chameleon again.

			#LOC_GPP_ScienceDefs_MysteryGoo_GaelSrfLandedVolcano = The goo... The goo... The goo is on firrrrre! ...You sing it because, it flows and ripples upward and is colored as though it's actually a fire.
			#LOC_GPP_ScienceDefs_MysteryGoo_GaelSrfLandedMountains = The goo forms a hand and points in the direction of GSC. Evidently it didn't care for the landing either.
			#LOC_GPP_ScienceDefs_MysteryGoo_GaelSrfLandedHighlands = The goo forms into a sword and shield. It must really be trying to say something.
			#LOC_GPP_ScienceDefs_MysteryGoo_GaelSrfLandedMidlands = The goo is particularly idle. Maybe it sleeps.
			#LOC_GPP_ScienceDefs_MysteryGoo_GaelSrfLandedLowlands = You catch the goo trying to slither down the side of the ship and escape. You make a special note about its chameleon trait.
			#LOC_GPP_ScienceDefs_MysteryGoo_GaelSrfLandedReefs = Somehow the goo is aware of the geology and forms into a sphere with the shape of this reef extruded on the surface.
			#LOC_GPP_ScienceDefs_MysteryGoo_GaelSrfLandedInlandWater = The goo finds nothing strange at all about somehow being landed in water.
			#LOC_GPP_ScienceDefs_MysteryGoo_GaelSrfLandedWater = The goo finds nothing strange at all about somehow being landed in water.
			#LOC_GPP_ScienceDefs_MysteryGoo_GaelSrfSplashedMinorShores = A large fin shape forms on the surface of the goo and begins moving in a circular motion.
			#LOC_GPP_ScienceDefs_MysteryGoo_GaelSrfSplashedUakoraShores = Somehow, someway the goo actually manages to appear more lovely here than anywhere else. This is truly mystifying.
			#LOC_GPP_ScienceDefs_MysteryGoo_GaelSrfSplashedPligiaShores = The goo smoothes out and forms a shape of a serene coastline with lapping waves. The goo is pleased.
			#LOC_GPP_ScienceDefs_MysteryGoo_GaelSrfSplashedEucriaShores = You barely spot the goo as it camoflagues itself again within the container. Apparently the goo feels playful in the Eucria region.
			#LOC_GPP_ScienceDefs_MysteryGoo_GaelSrfSplashedGoonieShores = //blank b/c no def written yet
			#LOC_GPP_ScienceDefs_MysteryGoo_GaelSrfSplashedReefs = The goo forms into a chunk of coral, with hard, sparkly bits and squiggly ripples very prominent about it.
			#LOC_GPP_ScienceDefs_MysteryGoo_GaelSrfSplashedInlandWater = The goo starts expanding at a slow and constant pace. Then you quickly close the canister and hope the quite possibly chemical process starves and stops.
			#LOC_GPP_ScienceDefs_MysteryGoo_GaelSrfSplashedWater = The goo herds itself to the ceiling of the canister and develops a solid exterior. It must have a serious bias against salt water.
			#LOC_GPP_ScienceDefs_MysteryGoo_IotaInSpaceHigh = The goo seems puffy. Mmm... Mystery Puffs. Wait, what are you thinking?!
			#LOC_GPP_ScienceDefs_MysteryGoo_IotaInSpaceLow = The goo reaches out at the surface. It must have as much yearning for the candy moon Iota as you have.
			#LOC_GPP_ScienceDefs_MysteryGoo_IotaSrfLandedSkids = //blank b/c no def written yet
			#LOC_GPP_ScienceDefs_MysteryGoo_IotaSrfLandedHighlands = The goo attempts to ooze down the side of the device but you wave your finger at it and it withdraws like a good boy.
			#LOC_GPP_ScienceDefs_MysteryGoo_IotaSrfLandedMidlands = The goo leans back within its container. It must be upset with no current opportunity to escape and taste Iota first.
			#LOC_GPP_ScienceDefs_MysteryGoo_IotaSrfLandedLowlands = The goo forms into a hammer. It must want you to strike the surface and unwittingly grant it the honor of First Taste.
			#LOC_GPP_ScienceDefs_MysteryGoo_IotaSrfLandedDroops = The goo simply hangs from its container. It may be unsure whether this part of the moon is actually candy.
			#LOC_GPP_ScienceDefs_MysteryGoo_CetiInspaceHigh = The goo mimics the contours of Ceti's surface. Maybe it knows you don't like it.
			#LOC_GPP_ScienceDefs_MysteryGoo_CetiInSpaceLow = The goo writhes and shivers. It may be a farfetched idea but maybe the goo is also very unhappy to be here.
			#LOC_GPP_ScienceDefs_MysteryGoo_CetiSrfLandedPlateaus = You observe one wave-like motion on the goo's surface, as though a pebble splashed down. The goo must be in some sort of contented state.
			#LOC_GPP_ScienceDefs_MysteryGoo_CetiSrfLandedHighlands = The goo once again mimics the ground detail. It's an amusing sight as this biome is a palatable one.
			#LOC_GPP_ScienceDefs_MysteryGoo_CetiSrfLandedMidlands = You see wave motions in the goo's surface. You log this as one of the most random or cryptic responses ever observed from this kooky stuff.
			#LOC_GPP_ScienceDefs_MysteryGoo_CetiSrfLandedLowlands = The goo once again forms a protruding arrow pointing at Gael. You figure the goo to be quite childish.
			#LOC_GPP_ScienceDefs_MysteryGoo_CetiSrfLandedPoles = The goo gives no discernable reaction. It must have mixed emotions and feel as conflicted about the polar surface as you do.
			//------------------------------
			#LOC_GPP_ScienceDefs_TSTScopeCiro = Staring into Ciro directly you find an unfathomable, wonderful sight...to the point that your mortal eyeballs quickly burn.
			#LOC_GPP_ScienceDefs_TSTScopeIcarus = This planet vaguely resembles ocean dwellers. Probably deep fried ocean dwellers.
			#LOC_GPP_ScienceDefs_TSTScopeThalia = Something about this body seems oddly...unnerving. Do we really want to send anything there?
			#LOC_GPP_ScienceDefs_TSTScopeEta = Oh look, a little white moon! It seemsa little spoky but eh, we can deal with it.
			#LOC_GPP_ScienceDefs_TSTScopeNiven = We find ourselves a beautiful orange planet. It looks hot and dry... But it's the closest one. We need to launch something.
			#LOC_GPP_ScienceDefs_TSTScopeGael = Pretty planet! Looking back at it makes one far more appreciative of where we come from.
			#LOC_GPP_ScienceDefs_TSTScopeIota = We're going to enjoy staring at this one for a long time. It looks good for dipping in coffee.
			#LOC_GPP_ScienceDefs_TSTScopeCeti = We're not going to enjoy staring at this one for a long time. But we will conquer it regardless...for science!
			#LOC_GPP_ScienceDefs_TSTScopeTellumo = Gael! You never told us you had a big sister! ...Bring all the super-smart Gaeleans. We need to know if we can land on this.
			#LOC_GPP_ScienceDefs_TSTScopeLili = Wait... There's something solid in those rings. What do we call this?
			#LOC_GPP_ScienceDefs_TSTScopeGratian = The planet's palette seems confusing and tempting. Surely it's entirely a desert. But it has ice? And what is all that red stuff anyway? It looks like cinnamon, or cayenne pepper, or...
			#LOC_GPP_ScienceDefs_TSTScopeGeminus = We would say this moon is trying in vain to get our attention, but its veins easily have our attention.
			#LOC_GPP_ScienceDefs_TSTScopeOtho = This gas planet has some pretty tasty colors! Oh crap! It has an eye!
			#LOC_GPP_ScienceDefs_TSTScopeAugustus = Fascinating. It seems to strongly resemble Otho. You wonder what the views are like.
			#LOC_GPP_ScienceDefs_TSTScopeHephaestus = You realize that there are many shades of yellow in Otho's local space.
			#LOC_GPP_ScienceDefs_TSTScopeJannah = This moon is awefully dark but just as yellow in hue as everything else. What's really going on here?
			#LOC_GPP_ScienceDefs_TSTScopeGauss = A particular angry-looking gas giant fills the frame. Its swirling storms seem higher in number than those of the othe giants.
			#LOC_GPP_ScienceDefs_TSTScopeLoki = This moon looks scary, somewhat like Thalia. Maybe they are close relatives?
			#LOC_GPP_ScienceDefs_TSTScopeCatullus = Purple! It's purple! In addition, is this a gas planet? ...Orbiting a gas planet???
			#LOC_GPP_ScienceDefs_TSTScopeTarsiss = This curious little world seems to be a moon of a moon. How rare is that? The purple spots are intriguing too.
			#LOC_GPP_ScienceDefs_TSTScopeNero = Everything else suddenly loses all meaning at the sight of this gas planet. Its rings and colors command all attention.
			#LOC_GPP_ScienceDefs_TSTScopeHadrian = You find that this moon strongly resembles Gael and Tellumo, with its obvious abundant oceans. But is that really water in those oceans?
			#LOC_GPP_ScienceDefs_TSTScopeNarisse = Just as you discover this planet, a scientist enters the room with a bag of chocolate snacks that oddly resemble this.
			#LOC_GPP_ScienceDefs_TSTScopeMuse = The look of this, by far, is eccentric. It gets you really thinking. After a minute of which, you realize that is why it has its name.
			#LOC_GPP_ScienceDefs_TSTScopeMinona = This moon turns out to be a very particular kind...the kind that's uneventful on one side and has a story to tell on the other side.
			#LOC_GPP_ScienceDefs_TSTScopeAgrippina = The observation team takes notice of the lack of size and abundance of green. Its closeness to Gaelean skin begs for closer investigation.
			#LOC_GPP_ScienceDefs_TSTScopeJulia = It's brown, it's gray, it's probably ice. And it's got one of the most interesting orbits out there!
			#LOC_GPP_ScienceDefs_TSTScopeHox = This remote place, although seeming bland and tiny, clearly holds promise.
			#LOC_GPP_ScienceDefs_TSTScopeArgo = At first you think this wonderful body is a discreet planet about to eclipse Hox, or be eclipsed. But then you realize it's quite a moon with quite an orbit.
			#LOC_GPP_ScienceDefs_TSTScopeLeto = Oh look, an ice planet. It seems pretty lonely, even lonelier than Hox. We can send it some love...but we will need a few orders of magnitude bigger launchers.
			#LOC_GPP_ScienceDefs_TSTScopeGrannus = What's this bright red light? A nearby dwarf star? Zoom harder, we need more details!
			//------------------------------
			#LOC_GPP_ScienceDefs_TSTChem_Ica0 = Visual and other experiments will tell you that this place is quite dry and hostile, however, this analysis suggests an incredible abundance of life-sustaining materials.
			#LOC_GPP_ScienceDefs_TSTChem_Tha0 = Analysis reveals exceptional heights of fissile and metallic chemicals. What triggered the planet's chemical transformation to this state must be no less than astronomical.
			#LOC_GPP_ScienceDefs_TSTChem_Eta0 = The device reveals nominal concentrations of precious materials. The moon seems to have been spared from whatever affected its parent.
			#LOC_GPP_ScienceDefs_TSTChem_Eta0 = The chemical configuration in this moon's surface is intrguing. Its incredibly irregular topology must be a result of more than just geological activity.
			#LOC_GPP_ScienceDefs_TSTChem_Niv0 = The readouts seem nominal, apart from a moderate abundance of fissile material and a great lack of sustaining elements for life a we know it.
			#LOC_GPP_ScienceDefs_TSTChem_Niv1 = The results are fairly depressing. There's no sign of free water or water-bearing chemicals.
			#LOC_GPP_ScienceDefs_TSTChem_Niv2 = The chemistry here is peculiar. It is far from any familiar range of configurations.
			#LOC_GPP_ScienceDefs_TSTChem_Niv3 = Igneous materials are very abundant here. Perhaps this region was held back in some way from cooling down when Niven formed.
			#LOC_GPP_ScienceDefs_TSTChem_Gael0 = The findings do not fail to impress. This makes a great addition to the baseline catalog of chemical configurations.
			#LOC_GPP_ScienceDefs_TSTChem_Gael1 = As your study of Gael grows, so does the list of flavors for these scan results. Igneous and semi-exotic materials abound.
			#LOC_GPP_ScienceDefs_TSTChem_Gael2 = The saline and silicate centered data makes a fine data record.
			#LOC_GPP_ScienceDefs_TSTChem_Gael3 = You find the shores here to have a unique and even more mineral rich composiiton than the Minor Shores have.
			#LOC_GPP_ScienceDefs_TSTChem_Gael4 = Just like the Goonie Shores, the chemical compositions stand out. Particularly, there's less of one exotic thing and more of another.
			#LOC_GPP_ScienceDefs_TSTChem_Gael5 = Something seems even more special about the shores of this island. You wonder whether it's another 'flavor' of nature or something, or someone, intervened.
			#LOC_GPP_ScienceDefs_TSTChem_Gael6 = Surface Water seems pretty abundant, along with a lot of what can be classified as Mulch. Evidently, the trees around here aren't as perky and fluffy as elsewhere on Gael.
			#LOC_GPP_ScienceDefs_TSTChem_Gael7 = Nothing but Water.
			#LOC_GPP_ScienceDefs_TSTChem_Iota0 = You find a interesting high presence of hydrocarbons. Although the experiment reveals that Iota is not actually a sugar ball in space, it reveals that there's plenty of the raw stuff here to make a sugar ball in space.
			#LOC_GPP_ScienceDefs_TSTChem_Iota1 = Analysis reveals a fairly high balance of silicates in this region.
			#LOC_GPP_ScienceDefs_TSTChem_Iota2 = You find an abnormality in the composition here. It doe not make sense yet but maybe it has something to do with this place being called the Droops.
			#LOC_GPP_ScienceDefs_TSTChem_Ceti0 = You find a pretty nominal balance of chemicals here. Nothing amazing, but it's a good serving of science. And science is always good.
			#LOC_GPP_ScienceDefs_TSTChem_Ceti1 = The surface composition at this altitude strongly resembles one or more direct samples from somewhere on Gael. This makes you wonder what it would be like if Ceti had an atmosphere.
			#LOC_GPP_ScienceDefs_TSTChem_Ceti2 = At last you get a deep look into what it is that makes the ground here blue and pink... Maybe these things can be sanitized and used to color food?
			#LOC_GPP_ScienceDefs_TSTChem_Ceti3 = The cushy, caramel surface here is revealed to be high in palatable compounds. Perhaps a little rekerjiggering and this ground can easily become fields for crops.
			#LOC_GPP_ScienceDefs_TSTChem_Tell0 = The analysis blows your mind for the most part. This surface composition is so familiar that it almost suggests that Gael was a piece that broke off from Tellumo.
			#LOC_GPP_ScienceDefs_TSTChem_Tell1 = Nothing but Water... Just like on Gael. It doesn't seem as pure, though.
			#LOC_GPP_ScienceDefs_TSTChem_Tell2 = Apparently there is rebellion in the polar regions. There turns out to be very little diference between this and the Ice Caps.
			#LOC_GPP_ScienceDefs_TSTChem_Tell3 = You find a high balance of silica and organics like on Gael, however, there are notable distinctions. Perhaps Tellumo is ripe to produce its own sentient life form.
			#LOC_GPP_ScienceDefs_TSTChem_Tell4 = The surface chemistry bares the most likeness to that of Gael's Tundra. It's slightly confusing in that it's really cold everywhere so nearly everywhere is technically Tundra.
			#LOC_GPP_ScienceDefs_TSTChem_Lili0 = There's an astonishing abundance of combustible things within this moon, and a saddening lack of most other materials. They must have all easily fallen into Tellumo.
			#LOC_GPP_ScienceDefs_TSTChem_Grat0 = The chemical scan data pours in. The strings are so long that the hard drive's file system can't support it all.
			#LOC_GPP_ScienceDefs_TSTChem_Grat1 = The camera itself throws a warning about overexposure. The scan suggests a very high presence of a material with extraordinary energy density.
			#LOC_GPP_ScienceDefs_TSTChem_Grat2 = The scan data shows strong resemblance to very beneficial edible substances. Looks like the astronomer was right to name this place Cinnamon!
			#LOC_GPP_ScienceDefs_TSTChem_Grat3 = Another unfathomable data stream pours in. The extraordinary color, even on this planet, was a telltale sign of this waiting to happen.
			#LOC_GPP_ScienceDefs_TSTChem_Grat4 = Remarkably, there indeed happens to be an amazing proportion of certain culinary traces in this region, along with a lot of non-Water ice.

			#LOC_GPP_ScienceDefs_TSTChem_Gem0 = You find nothing particularly remarkable. However, you do stumble upon a higher concentration of alikali Minerals here than elsewhere among the Galilean planets.
			#LOC_GPP_ScienceDefs_TSTChem_Gem1 = The findings here are no less surprising than findings elswhere about this moon. In particular, there's something to said about this ridge above the others.
			#LOC_GPP_ScienceDefs_TSTChem_Gem2 = You find that the composition, like the color, varies widely up here from down in the trenches and lowlands.

			#LOC_GPP_ScienceDefs_TSTChem_Aug0 = The findings intrigue you. The secrets of the tangerine sand begin to unfold.
			#LOC_GPP_ScienceDefs_TSTChem_Aug1 = You smile at the findings in this region. Unlike Niven, the poles here actually have Water.
			#LOC_GPP_ScienceDefs_TSTChem_Aug2 = You notice a fair difference in the sand in this biome where it's really heaped up versus most other places on this moon.

			#LOC_GPP_ScienceDefs_TSTChem_Heph0 = The height of metal content in this crust surprises you.
			#LOC_GPP_ScienceDefs_TSTChem_Heph1 = The sensor data shows evidence of corruption. Something in the surface here must be affecting the machinery.
			#LOC_GPP_ScienceDefs_TSTChem_Heph2 = You find a high concentration of igneous material.It is not very interesting itself but the kinds of crust and compositions around it make it so.
			#LOC_GPP_ScienceDefs_TSTChem_Heph3 = The chemical composition seems quite nominal. It is valuable science but it does not contribute to the understanding of why this immense riverbed, is.
			#LOC_GPP_ScienceDefs_TSTChem_Heph4 = The composition here has a distinct signature. The root of the yellow hue on this dry moon seems to be in certain metallic signatures.

			#LOC_GPP_ScienceDefs_TSTChem_Jan0 = You find a fair deficiency in organic materials. It does not seem worrisome at first, but later on, it might...
			#LOC_GPP_ScienceDefs_TSTChem_Jan1 = Contrary to its name, the abyss here turns out to be very rich in precious chemicals.

			#LOC_GPP_ScienceDefs_TSTChem_Loki0 = Analysis reveals that exotic processes occured within this moon's history as well. These processes must have been somewhat...subtractive.
			#LOC_GPP_ScienceDefs_TSTChem_Loki1 = The ground seems highly saturated with only a few sorts of chemicals. Evidently there is a hint that the ChemCam's laser cannot penetrate very far into this crust.
			#LOC_GPP_ScienceDefs_TSTChem_Loki2 = Igneous materials are fairly abundant here, but there is no lack of other interesting resources.
			#LOC_GPP_ScienceDefs_TSTChem_Loki3 = This surface is plentiful with carbonaceous and fascinating compounds. It may be worth your while to take an extra surface sample.
			#LOC_GPP_ScienceDefs_TSTChem_Loki4 = You find high concentrations of some saline materials. They could be the root of this whitish color.
			#LOC_GPP_ScienceDefs_TSTChem_Loki5 = The results are in...... This crust is so dark, even the ChemCam can't see in it.

			#LOC_GPP_ScienceDefs_TSTChem_Catu0 = There's an interesting extreme of abundances here. Some materials are in very short supply, others are in no short supply at all. Catullus is indeed some kind of hybrid planet.

			#LOC_GPP_ScienceDefs_TSTChem_Tars0 = The surface of this moon is most curious. Concentrations of organic materials far surpass the concentrations of other classes. This makes things ever more interesting.

			#LOC_GPP_ScienceDefs_TSTChem_Hadr0 = Among the various essential materials you find an unprecedented presence of Nitrogen. This one is definitely making history.
			#LOC_GPP_ScienceDefs_TSTChem_Hadr1 = Some fairly exotic materials populate this portion of the crust. You wonder why, but you're glad it's a different result to the last scan.
			#LOC_GPP_ScienceDefs_TSTChem_Hadr2 = There's no very spacial variation to the chemical composition of this part of this moon. But it's more science and it's cool to have it. Get it? Cool? Heh.

			#LOC_GPP_ScienceDefs_TSTChem_Nar0 = The study proves in-conclusive. The data does not confirm whether or not Narisse is indeed a giant Resse's Peanut Butter Cup.

			#LOC_GPP_ScienceDefs_TSTChem_Muse0 = The analysis gives you something new to think about. It is cryptic for the most part, but it clearly tells there are a few important shortages of chemicals.

			#LOC_GPP_ScienceDefs_TSTChem_Min0 = You find nothing particularly appealing in the scan results. That turns out to be a good thing and worthy of a smile.
			#LOC_GPP_ScienceDefs_TSTChem_Agr0 = The results are in! Some organic material is present here!
			#LOC_GPP_ScienceDefs_TSTChem_Agr1 = There's not much to say. The proportion of ice is immense.
			#LOC_GPP_ScienceDefs_TSTChem_Agr2 = Minerals and organics are relatively abundant here.
			#LOC_GPP_ScienceDefs_TSTChem_Jul0 = There's not much to say. The proportion of ice is immense.
			#LOC_GPP_ScienceDefs_TSTChem_Jul1 = The variety of ice here is unique. The things in it aren't palatable at all but are still useful.
			#LOC_GPP_ScienceDefs_TSTChem_Hox0 = You discover an immense presence of solid Nitrogren in the surface. Things don't seem quite as bright as they were. Then again, you remember how far you are from Gael, and if you look up at the right time, hope will pass overhead.
			#LOC_GPP_ScienceDefs_TSTChem_Hox1 = The scan data is oddly reassuring, with the presences of some various materials, once you look past the need for basic life support.
			#LOC_GPP_ScienceDefs_TSTChem_Argo0 = Analysis reveals quite an abundance of water and a fair portion of other life-sustaining materials. It's a pity that there's no atmosphere or more tidal heat.
			#LOC_GPP_ScienceDefs_TSTChem_Argo1 = Good news, everyone! The crust is really thin here. We could make ourselves a pool!
			#LOC_GPP_ScienceDefs_TSTChem_Argo2 = The scan determines that this Water ice is over 80% pure compared to Gael's ice caps.
			#LOC_GPP_ScienceDefs_TSTChem_Leto0 = This surface is rich with some materials fit for industrial production, even developing some advancd gear. The remaining data does not suggest, however, that a manned mission would be very worthwhile.
			#LOC_GPP_ScienceDefs_TSTChem_Leto1 = The composition here isn't very different from eslewhere on Leto, or Hox for that matter. If there were any planets after this one, maybe they would be the same too... Full of Nitrogen and little else.

These dreams inspired highly eccentric stories that were hidden until his passing. One of these even went as far as to say something about controlling this spice and the universe. Maybe he was onto something...

			#LOC_GPP_Planets_Hadrian_displayName = Hadrian^N
			#LOC_GPP_Planets_Hadrian_description = The only world bearing oceans between Gratian and Leto, Hadrian wears the mantle of King of Moons and offers royal frozen treats to explorers. Maybe Nero's incorporeal edible treasures lay here.

		//GPP/GPP_Planets/Hephaestus.cfg
			#LOC_GPP_Planets_Hephaestus_displayName = Hephaestus^N
			#LOC_GPP_Planets_Hephaestus_description = The name of this moon sounds like it should have a lot to do with smithing and construction. Evidently it sure seems to be the workplace of higher beings, looking like it itself burst open and bled under unfathomable workloads. Given the looks of the other planets they did quite a job.
			#LOC_GPP_Planets_Biome_BrazenFieldsDisplayName = Brazen Fields

		//GPP/GPP_Planets/Icarus.cfg
			#LOC_GPP_Planets_Icarus_displayName = Icarus^N
			#LOC_GPP_Planets_Icarus_description = It took a long time to discover this gem due to its size and its proximity to the inferno. Its appearance strongly inspires seafood and a visit would be as exquisite. The ability to get here and back without bankrupting GSC, melting or upsetting Gael's biosphere would be treated with great prestige.

		//GPP/GPP_Planets/Iota.cfg
			#LOC_GPP_Planets_Iota_displayName = Iota^N
			#LOC_GPP_Planets_Iota_description = The easiest thing to spot in the sky; Its smooth yet gritty textures and neutral colors may have made it the first celestial body to be associated with snacks.

		//GPP/GPP_Planets/Jannah.cfg
			#LOC_GPP_Planets_Jannah_displayName = Jannah^N
			#LOC_GPP_Planets_Jannah_description = Jannah seems analogous to the one kid in the class who nobody ever minds, or who always avoids everyone. Either way, if she senses that a landing party has pity on her she might get touchy and threaten to raise her orbit or inclination.

		//GPP/GPP_Planets/Julia.cfg
			#LOC_GPP_Planets_Julia_displayName = Julia^N
			#LOC_GPP_Planets_Julia_description = A Nereid and very different flavor of planetoid. This maiden clearly wandered by and paid more than one visit to Nero's kourt in her lifetime. She found herself invited to hang around, but not worthy to hang very closely.
			#LOC_GPP_Planets_Biome_LesserPigmentsDisplayName = Lesser Pigments

			#LOC_GPP_Planets_Leto_displayName = Leto^N
			#LOC_GPP_Planets_Leto_description = The border world. The least is known about this rogue scoop of snowcone. The only sure thing is that its orbital properties make it a very un-affordable snowcone.

		//GPP/GPP_Planets/Lili.cfg
			#LOC_GPP_Planets_Lili_displayName = Lili^N
			#LOC_GPP_Planets_Lili_description = Well what do we have here? A proverbial lump in the dough when Tellumo formed, or a moon that died and is rising again?

		//GPP/GPP_Planets/Muse.cfg
			#LOC_GPP_Planets_Muse_displayName = Muse^N
			#LOC_GPP_Planets_Muse_description = The topography of this moon is among the most intriguing or muse-inducing ever seen. Conventional Geo-science cannot explain how Muse got his enormous swept gorges and wheat or cauliflower-like patches. Perhaps he made a grave misdeed and invoked Nero's wrath.

			#LOC_GPP_Planets_Narisse_description = This moon has been politely described as a malformed peanut butter cup by the scientist who found it, and who happened to be munching on the same at the time... Given its sheer lack of size how did that Gaelean even notice?

		//GPP/GPP_Planets/Nero.cfg
			#LOC_GPP_Planets_Nero_displayName = Nero^N
			#LOC_GPP_Planets_Nero_description = Rightfully named, this planet kommands the stellar kourt and wears his rings slanted for all to behold. Some Gaeleans have gathered under a belief that a Heaven exists in his domain, filled with snacks that no corporeal Gaelean can reach or fathom.

			#LOC_GPP_Planets_Niven_displayName = Niven^N
			#LOC_GPP_Planets_Niven_description = The beautiful orange sky here made mouths water on first observation. Gaelkind knows that since it's closer to the star it's going to be a little warmer outdoors than anyone is accustomed to on Gael.

			#LOC_GPP_Planets_Otho_displayName = Otho^N
			#LOC_GPP_Planets_Otho_description = The first of the gas giants is a very mellow and very yellow entity. The sight of him and his fellow yellow moons is breathtaking. Even the rowdiest individual quiets down when they catch Otho staring back at them.

			#LOC_GPP_Planets_Biome_HazyHaloDisplayName = Hazy Halo

		//GPP/GPP_Planets/Tellumo.cfg
			#LOC_GPP_Planets_Tellumo_displayName = Tellumo^N
			#LOC_GPP_Planets_Tellumo_description = The concepts of identical and binary twins are far from foreign to Gaelkind. But to find this in Gael's shadow! Nothing could accelerate a space program more than the dream to land on a second planet that is safe to take off a helmet at and grill things for the crew. The one big problem, though, is all the gravioli.

		//GPP/GPP_Planets/Thalia.cfg
			#LOC_GPP_Planets_Thalia_displayName = Thalia^N
			#LOC_GPP_Planets_Thalia_description = The cursed planet. After first tracking her as a red glimmer some Gaelean scientists pointed a larger telescope her way and quickly considered early retirement. Although she lacks considerably in gravity, her looks, among other things, will effectively repel passing landers. It is believed she may have had an atmosphere rich in combustible materials but a massive impact ignited it and disfigured her.

			#LOC_GPP_Secondary_Kiro_DisplayName = Kiro^N
			#LOC_GPP_Secondary_Ciro_description = Among the countless yellow main sequence stars Ciro itself appears at first to be nothing special, but it's the center of a very inviting and very rich system. What bountiful surprises await within its SOI? This is why we have space programs.
			#LOC_GPP_Secondary_Kiro_description = Among the countless yellow main sequence stars Kiro itself appears at first to be nothing special, but it's the center of a very inviting and very rich system. What bountiful surprises await within its SOI? This is why we have space programs.

			#LOC_GPP_Secondary_Krannus_DisplayName = Krannus^N
			#LOC_GPP_Secondary_Grannus_description = As it turns out, Ciro is very far from alone in its little corner of the galaxy. Prancing about even to the edge of its SOI is this angry, lonely M-class dwarf. Is Grannus itself truly lonely and the sole holder of a barren system, or like Ciro, is it hiding a bounty?
			#LOC_GPP_Secondary_Krannus_description = As it turns out, Kiro is very far from alone in its little corner of the galaxy. Prancing about even to the edge of its SOI is this angry, lonely M-class dwarf. Is Krannus itself truly lonely and the sole holder of a barren system, or like Kiro, is it hiding a bounty?

		//OptionalMods/GPP_Secondary/Gael.cfg
			#LOC_GPP_Secondary_Gael_description = A terrestrial planet and untouched paradise awaiting the inevitable exploration force. It is the crown jewel of this particular dual-star system, and is made even more special by having a large and equally regal?twin among its immediate neighbors.
