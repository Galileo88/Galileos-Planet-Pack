## GPP_Rescale

GPP_Rescale is an optional mod that rescales the GPP solar system to either 2.5x or 10x its normal size. Rescaling is accomplished without the use of Sigma Dimensions (these mods should never be used in combination with Sigma Dimensions). GPP also works with GEP and/or JNSQ in any of the following installation options, using the appropriate GPP, GEP and JNSQ rescale mods to provide size compatibility.

  * GPP                                          |
  * GPP + GEP                                    |
  * GEP + GEP_Primary + GPP + GPP_Secondary      | + applicable Rescale mods (scales should match)
  * JNSQ + GPP + GPP_Secondary                   |
  * JNSQ + GPP + GPP_Secondary + GEP             |

For any other combination of planet packs, rescaling should be performed using Sigma Dimensions without GPP_Rescale.

To install GPP_Rescale:

1. Download and install Galileo's Planet Pack per the installation instructions.

2. Drill down to [GPP Download]\Optional Mods\GPP_Rescale\ and select either Rescale_2.5X or Rescale_10X.

3. Copy/merge the selected GameData folder into your KSP install.

4. If applicable, download and install GEP and/or JNSQ and the appropriate rescale mods per their instructions.

5. Delete the Kopernicus cache, i.e. the *.bin files located within each planet pack's Cache folder.

6. It is recommended that the DSN modifier in game difficulty match the rescale factor, i.e. 2.5 or 10.
